Dude, just finished watching Last Breath and honestly, I'm still trying to catch mine, no pun intended. Like, were they literally trying to give us a heart attack or what? It's so insane how chill those guys are under the sea, just another day at the office, right? I mean, they could film these things as horror movies, and nobody would even notice.

But yo, I feel like I gotta say, downloading the movie first made me feel like I was doing underwater missions or something. High stakes, man. And that breathing. Ugh, suffocating just thinking about it. Itâ€™s like, do we even know how easy we have it up here on dry land? 

>Did you see when the equipment cracked? Liiike, how are they not losing it down there? I swear, I would've been like, Okay, nope. Bring me back up this instant! But no, these guys are casually solving problems deep under the ocean like it's some Tuesday sudoku. Mad respect, seriously. 

And the shots! Gotta admit, the ocean looked amazing on my screen. Almost made me want to dive in myself. Almost. Not a chance I'm putting on all that gear though, that's for sure. Imagine doing that every day. Might stick to just watching the movie instead. ðŸ˜‚ 

But you know what really blew my mind? The team effort. Everybody has to be so in sync, like some human version of Finding Dory but more hardcore. The way they communicated, kept calm... I think Iâ€™d just freak out and start yelling random stuff if I were there. 

var mindBlown = true;

Anyway, I should probably sleep off this underwater anxiety. Who thought watching other people nearly drown would keep you up at night, huh?ðŸ¤£ Next dive session, we can just watch people drink coffee or something, yeah? Peace out!
